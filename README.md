Religion and Wealth: How important is religion in formulating wealth?

Let me preface this analysis by saying this: I have nothing against those who are religious! I don't mean any disrespect. In fact, I respect them wholeheartedly. I am just writing my analysis to get a nice project out of my long-held question.

When I was young, my family emphasized behaving respectfully, building connections and talking to a lot of people, because you really don't know who you will meet. For immigrants, the usual support network tends to be a religious one, so our family went to church very often. 

In my hometown, I saw a lot of wealthy people in the church. Kind of a no-brainer, given that we drove to more well-off areas to go to a "good" church to meet well-dressed people. 

Now that I am a nonbeliever, I came up with the following question:

For the practical nonbeliever looking for connections and wealth accumulation, what religion is best to get into?

I know this is probably against the teachings of the majority of religions out there, what with love for materialistic things being branded evil. I, however, want to feed my morbid curiosity. So let us see! Is it the Christians, with their staggering populations? Is it Judaism, with the humourous notions of secretive wealth societies? Or is it Islam, where it is obligatory for the rich to give to the poor (or else it be a great sin), plus oil money? Is it Protestants, Confucianism, etc. or is it another surprising religion?

First let's do some Exploratory Data Analysis. Let us look at the growing numbers of each religion over time. Let's look at their trends to see which had the greatest growth (and by extension, had the most incentive and outreach and influence to join)?

Of course, there are falling numbers of new joiners since the world as a whole is starting to become atheistic.

But let's look. Oh! (Insert Religion Here) is the greatest in number of joiners, while (Insert Religion Here) has the least in terms of growth. (This religion) is going down, as a matter of fact.

All of these new joiners could mean something (something must have drawn them in, after all).

Next, let's look at the heatmap (distribution map) of the religions across the US in the current year, courtesy of Tableau. It seems like religions are rather evenly spread out. 

Great! Now let's see if higher populations (or density) of people equate to a greater leverage over power and wealth accumulation (measured by population of millionaires). Let's plot a linear graph between population points and number of millionaires.








"One problem is that the number of millionaires are self-reported, so is it better to use other metrics for measures of wealth and power?"

"Cool, cool. Now let's use a Hessian / or something matrix to remove any variables that don't really impact us:"




ALRIGHT! We have found that the number of religious populations (does / does not correlate much) with power/wealth accumulation.

What other factors might affect this?

This project can be extended to set up businesses in local areas where money would be greatly funneled by religions, so this can answer a few business questions. Normally,
